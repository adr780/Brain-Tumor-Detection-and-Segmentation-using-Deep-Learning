# Brain-Tumor-Detection-and-Segmentation-using-Deep-Learning

Brain tumor identification is a really challenging task in the early stages of life. These days the issue of brain tumor automatic identification is of great interest. A tumor is the unusual growth of the tissues. A brain tumor is a number of unnecessary cells growing in the brain or central spinal canal.  It is the unrestrained progress of cancer cells in any portion of the body. 

Deep learning techniques can be used in order to detect the brain tumor of a patient using the MRI images of a patientâ€™s brain. In this application, we are helping the doctors and patients to classify the type of scan for the specific image given with the help of Neural Networks and store the patient's data.
